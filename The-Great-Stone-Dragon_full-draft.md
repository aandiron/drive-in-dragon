# The Great Stone Dragon

First, I need you to understand that what I'm going to tell you about here might seem unbelievable, but it really did happen to me. 

I say 'unbelievable,' but I don't use that word in the sense of something that is just _unlikely_ to have actually happened --- like the not-very-believable sexual encounters related in the old *Penthouse Forum Letters* section --- I mean 'unbelievable' in the sense that most people would think that what happened to me just could *not* ever have happened. And I haven't ever told anyone about this before. Not because of prudish shyness (trust me, I am not a prude) or because I was afraid I wouldn't be believed, but rather because I was afraid anyone I told might think I had gone insane.

This all happened a very long time ago. But to this day I find the events of this one night some 25 years ago still arise in my thoughts far more often than I would like them to. Maybe what happened really only happened in my mind. Maybe I am --- or was ---- actually crazy. But I don't think so. I think what happened was one of those rare things --- though perhaps not as rare as we're led to believe --- where something occurred that was outside the bounds of what we consider "normal" reality. Whatever the explanation, I am hoping that by writing this all down, it will help my mind finally come to a more restful place, and maybe put the whole thing behind me once and for all.

The circumstances that led up to the event were banal enough. I had driven my little red two-door coupe 6 hours out west into the deeply rural region of the state to visit my boyfriend at the time, Lucas. He was a sophomore at a tiny liberal arts college that was surrounded by farmland and more than an hour from any city of notable size. 

My relationship with Lucas had been long distance and somewhat tenuous in all the usual long-distance relationship ways, particularly when you are talking about young people. Other than a few instances where we had actually managed to see each other in person, the relationship was held together by very hot and passionate phone calls every evening, that almost invariable ended with us having long sessions of phone sex. At least, when I didn't fall asleep on the phone with him!

As you could imagine, all that phone passion ended up mostly having the effect of building anticipation rather than being a reliable sexual outlet. I think by the time I made this trip out to see him we were both reaching a point where we were somewhat desperate for some pure physical interlocking, if you know what I mean.

It was my first trip out to visit him. In the past he had always made the trek to see me. So I was somewhat annoyed to arrive at the little house he lived in with his friends and realize that we didn't have much privacy. There were all these boys around all the time. Underfed art students dressed in black mostly, who would hang out on the porch... and in the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, their bedrooms. In short, there were just always boys around. And all I wanted was Lucas to myself. We snuck in some quiet fucking the first night I was there, but I think we both felt like we didn't really have the freedom to be ourselves. It was slightly uncomfortable.

By the next evening I was so tired of all the art nerds that I was weighing the possibility of not staying the full three days I had originally planned, and instead heading home with the end of the weekend the next day. When I mentioned this to Lucas though he looked so distraught that I had to immediately backpedal that idea.

At the same time, I think he completely understood where I was coming from, and he tried to take some steps so that I would be more comfortable and enjoy myself more. 

"What if we go see a movie tonight?" He asked. "Out in the boonies around here, there's still a couple of functional drive-in theaters. And you have a car --- a rare asset among us poor college suckers. How about we go see something?"

"Hmm. That could be fun." I replied. I wasn't stupid, I immediately knew that a drive-in meant very little movie watching would actually get done. But I played along. "What's playing?"

Lucas found a copy of the local alternative paper on the coffee table. It was very thin and had a couple of coffee rings staining the cover, but it had the information we needed. "Well, Disney's *Mulan* is playing at the closest drive-in --- a mere 40 minutes away."

"*Mulan*? Isn't that a kid's movie? A cartoon?"

"Sure, but Disney's movies are generally solid entertainment these days. Even for adults. Besides, I like cartoons." Some of the little boy he still kind of was came through with this.

"Alright then. I don't feel too strongly about it. Take me to *Mulan* lover."

"We're not going to argue about this? I thought you said we were doomed as a couple because of our astrological signs?"

"You're a Gemini, I'm a Scorpio. That is a poison pill! Famously antagonistic. You and I, my hot little boy, are never going to work out."

"I am a rational person. I don't believe your occult magicks have any impact on the real world."

"And that right there is the first step towards our end baby."

The conversation was all in good humor, but it still put a little note of sour tiredness on everything we did for the next few hours while we waited for darkness to approach so we could head over to the drive-in.

By the time we were on our way, we had settled back into the dazed-crush state that our nightly phone calls had built up. It was hard not to feel romantic. I let Lucas drive my car, and we wound along narrow back country roads that would occasionally roll up to the top of hills from which we could see the liquid orange blob of the sun melting off on the Western horizon.

I kinda couldn't take my eyes off him. Even though if I were being honest he dressed just like all the other art nerds he hung around with. All in black, but not even tasteful black --- cheap oversized black tshirts, black pants, black combat boots. But this one was _my_ art nerd. I liked his shaved head, his paleness from rarely going out before dark, his young intensity.

He was trying to keep his eyes on the road, but he caught me staring at him. He gave me half a side-ways grin, and I leaned over and put my head on his shoulder. I had a smile on my face that I had no control over. I just kept grinning. I smiled as I sucked his ear. And I continued to smile as I undid his pants and slid my warm little hand down his boxers and took his cock in my hand. He was hard. Extremely hard. In that way that only 19 year old boys could be really. So hard that is gave not at all to the pressure of my fingers. It wasn't throbbing hard, it was just *hard* --- like a wooden dowel or something. There really wasn't anything I could even do with it. So I just held him in my hand while I whispered in his ear that he had better continue to concentrate on driving.

Somehow we made it to the drive-in without being killed. Lucas pulled my hand out and zipped himself up just as we pulled up to the booth. I could tell he was embarrassed by the hard-on he was failing to hide while he paid the rural teenage blonde girl in the booth for the movie. I was not embarrassed at all by the fact that my panties were already soaking wet.

I had worn something I knew he would like: a flowy black skirt that came down to just below my knees, a tight black halter top that made the most of the warm evenings of late summer, and also my small breasts. I had put lipstick on before we left --- a high-contrast red color that I loved in those younger years of mine.

The opening credits of *Mulan* were already rolling when Lucas steered my car into a space towards the back. I had his cock out again before he even put the gearshift into park. His cock was warm and like a little rock in my hand. I stared across at him, smiling happily while I stroked him slowly. He let out a long sigh of satisfaction with his eyes closed, and then opened them to look over at me. I didn't break eye contact while I lowered my lips to his cock. This was a bit of a trick, because I had to look up at him sideways. He slid the car seat back so I had more room.

Now, I'm not one to brag, but I will tell you honestly that I give the very best head. I've been told it's because of my full lips, but I think it's because I know what boys like: sloppy, wet, and no teeth! The way I figure it is that I _know_ boys like the sensation of pussy on their cock, so I just make my mouth as much like a pussy as possible --- and then add a little suction as bonus.

In this case I was already so turned on that I couldn't wait to get his cock in my mouth. As soon as my head reached his lap, I slowly closed my eyes and broke eye contact with him. I wanted to focus on his cock, and the whole eye-contact thing was just a gimmick to tease him with anyway.

As for Lucas' cock: I loved that thing. He wasn't huge, and he wasn't small. He was very appropriately proportioned! It had a nice gentle curve to it, --- which felt great in my pussy when he fucked me, and a full round tip that was also nicely proportioned in relation to the length and circumference of the shaft. And so hard. _Always_ hard. In the time I knew him --- admittedly, not really that long --- I'm fairly certain I never saw his cock when it wasn't hard. I'm serious! I don't know if that was a problem he had, or if I just did that to him. I prefer to believe the latter, of course.

Anyway, on this evening at the drive-in I licked my lips and touched them to the tip of his cock. I parted them slightly, and let my wet mouth slide over that well-proportioned tip. I just _love_ that sensation --- the spreading around the bulb of his cock before coming slightly back together at the shaft. Somehow that tiny movement is just so incredibly hot! That little moment made my pussy even wetter.

"Oh my god!" Lucas said, "Kendra, there is nothing like the way you suck my cock!" (He actually said this --- see? Told you I'm the best!)

Hearing him say this made me hungry to experience more of his cock, so I plunged my head down while letting out a long stifled groan --- stifled, of course, because my mouth was stuffed with his delicious dick.

I sucked away at him happily for a few minutes, but I could already taste his cum on my tongue. I knew he wasn't going to last if I kept giving him my world-class treatment. I lifted my head up, and taking his cock in my hand again stroked him slowly while I looked at him and caught my breath. "I want you in my pussy." I told him with unnecessary honesty.

I had to get my panties off. (I know --- you think I should have let him rip them off me. But I had worn my favorite pair for him! Purple, cute, and delicate lacey thongs. They were also fucking expensive! I wasn't about to let him ruin them.) I put my feet up on the dash, lifted my ass, hiked up my flowy black skirt and slipped my panties down my legs and over my toes. I stashed them in my handbag in the footwell. Lucas watched this whole operation while slowly stroking his cock. I felt like I was putting on a little show for him, even though all I wanted was my favorite panties safely out of the way.

EDITED TO HERE

I held my skirt up as I straddled him. His hands slid up my thighs, and I held his cock in my hand, guiding it towards my soaking, desperate pussy as I let my skirt slip back down over my legs and his hands.

The head of his cock touched my pussy, and again that sensation of widening --- his cock spreading my pussy apart so it could come back together around the shaft --- made me so hot. I couldn't be slow about this anymore. I plunged my hips down on him, and felt his cock sliding up into me. It felt lovely.

As good as it felt, I wasn't going to cum just from having his cock inside me. And one of the things I loved about Lucas is he knew that instinctively. His hands slid up to the top of my hips. I could feel his fingers grasping me on both sides under my skirt. He thrust himself upwards at the same time that he pulled me downwards. I gasped as his cock pushed ever further into me, but this got me down where I wanted to be --- with his whole cock inside me.

And now I could also feel the hard muscles of his abdomen pressing against my clit. I began to move. A long, slow grinding movement of my hips. I rolled with a slow rhythm back and forth, making his cock fuck my pussy and at the same time rubbing my clit gently against him.

One of the things I love about this move is it is the way to make the most of horny and lazy young boys. As long as you can keep them hard without cumming, they don't have to do anything but hold their cock inside you. Hell, when they try to move it just breaks my concentration and rhythm. I just need them to be an unrelenting cock-pole for me to fuck. It gives me the most intense orgasm.

The drawback is that usually these boys can't handle it, and they cum.

Lucas did his best. He reached his arms around me and held both sides of the steering wheel in a white-knuckle grip. He had his eyes closed and his head back --- I could almost see him trying to think about anything else to keep himself from cumming. Probably baseball, since that's likely the least-sexy thing for an art-nerd boy like Lucas.

I totally had him in my clutches then. I could have made him cum in a second if I wanted to. But I didn't I broke my rhythm just enough that he came around and got control of himself. Now, with slightly less risk of his early orgasm ruining everything, we could get down to some serious fucking. I took his face in my hands and kissed him slowly with a long wet kiss.

His hands let go of the steering wheel and made their way back up under my skirt. I could feel his fingers slip under the lower curve of my ass, and apply the white-knuckle grip there instead. I have to tell you: I just fucking love it when a man does that. _Whenever_ a guy does that, I get turned on --- even if it's in public and just for a second --- but when I'm in the middle of getting fucked, it makes me want to get my cunt pounded!

I leaned back a bit, and slid my hands up under his tshirt, lifting it up and feeling his chest under my fingers at the same time. I lifted my halter top, and pressed my small brown breasts against the naked skin of his chest. (I hadn't bothered with a bra of course.) 

I rubbed my body against his as I continued my rolling-hip fucking, his cock thrusting into me with each grind, his body sliding back and forth against my clit. He kept his hands under my ass, as if he were helping with the motion, but in reality, I was doing all the work.

I put my head on his shoulder and had a sweeping long orgasm. I could feel my pussy clenching on his cock and soaking it as I shook against him. It was one of those massive, quaking orgasms that goes on for what feels like 20 minutes, though I'm sure in reality it's just a minute or so. A full minute of shaking, unstoppable pleasure! Boys have no idea what a serious orgasm is like.

OK, you say. None of this is so shocking or unbelievable! What's the big deal? I'm coming right up to that.

As I ground out the last of my orgasm against him, his cock was still hard up inside me with an unwavering stiffness. I thought about what to do next with him, and how I would lead him to his own orgasm. Up on the screen, *Mulan* rolled on contributing nothing the entertainment in my car except a warm cartoon-colored glow.

"I want you to fuck me from behind." I whispered in his ear as I slipped his soaked rod out of myself. I got on my knees in the passenger seat and released the back to fold it down as flat as it would go. My legs were still shaking from my orgasm. I pulled my skirt up and looked back at him. 

Lucas was admiring my perfect little ass (it was _perfect_ at that time I tell you!) and my sopping pussy. He didn't even see me looking at him. He put his cock in me, and my eyes closed and I drooped my head as a long exhale of pleasure left me. I don't know about you, but I _love_ getting fucked from behind. It's harder for me to cum that way, but I love the sensation of being on my knees and the long thrust of a nice hard dick into me. It has an eternal quality to it that other positions just don't deliver.


From all the phone sex we had had, Lucas knew the explicit details of exactly what I liked, and he put all of that fine-grained knowledge to use now. He fucked me with long slow strokes, and then would shift gears and pound into me until he was breathing heavily and I could feel little drops of his sweat hitting my naked ass. He held my hips in his hands and drove into me. I held on to the car seat for dear life. I was really close to the edge of what my muscles could do and at risk of collapsing  --- I'm just a small girl you know!

It was when he was fucking me from behind like this that the thing I wanted to tell you about happened. As I said, I was holding on with my eyes closed. So I didn't _see_ anything at first. Rather, I _felt_ it. The first thing I noticed was a change in how his cock felt inside me. I said before, Lucas' cock was _well-prorportioned_ --- and by that I don't mean big --- just "a good size." But at this moment when he was fucking me from behind, I suddenly had the sensation that his cock was growing larger. Not like just a little throb, but it actually seemed to _grow_. It swelled in my pussy, in both length and girth, and it just got larger and larger. It felt like it was going to split me apart! I was afraid he might actually hurt me. What if a man is so big it does permanent damage? Can such a thing happen? I wasn't sure, but these kinds of questions sort of started floating abstractly through my mind.

His cock wasn't just getting bigger, it was getting _harder_ too. And I don't mean _stiffer_ I mean harder --- like his cock was becoming a solid object, rather than a meaty piece of flesh (no matter how tumescent).

I also suddenly felt like my car was bearing a much greater weight. I could swear the shocks had fully compressed on one side. And Lucas was breathing much more slowly and deeply, with a long hot breath that blew like a desert wind over my back, with enough force to stir my hair.

I knew I had to open my eyes. I looked over and Lucas' hand was gripping the edge of the driver's seat. Only it wasn't his hand, it was a great claw that I could swear was made of stone (at least that's what it looked to be by the orangish-blue cartoon light coming through the windshield). The claw was as big as my head with long, sharp nails digging into the upholstery of my car seat and slowly ripping chunks of foam from it.

The claw was the end of a sinewy, hard arm stretching back behind me and turning at a pointed elbow. The surface of the arm was of pebbly and cracked rock, yet formed as if sculpted from stone with the bulging shape of taut muscles. Heavily muscled, I might say. Leveraged with power for tearing with those claws.

Terrified by what I might see, my eyes followed the arm back to look behind me, and I tell you now with all the truth I can put into these words: Lucas had turned into a dragon. Or some kind of monster? What do I know about these things?

He was huge. His form filled the whole front of the car in a way that seemed impossible. And the car was clearly struggling under the weight of this beast. It had a belly of overlapped stone scales like asphalt roofing shingles, but with a curve to them. The head was massive and held above me on a long neck that was compressed into a serpentine S to allow the bulk of the head to fit into the low headroom of my tiny car. The teeth were entirely long rows of long T-rex incisors. (This was a creature that didn't chew his food --- it ripped it.) Horns sprouted in an unpleasant mass from his head and down his back. I could swear they were nothing but those giant teeth in a reversed direction. His eyes were the most disturbing though: reptile slits, forward pointed to give three-dimensional perception as they are in a predator animal. They gave the uncanny sense that they could see things far beyond the pitiful spectrum allowed to humans.

It did have wings. I know you were about to ask. They were paper thin and crammed together like folded bat-wings, the pinions pressed up against the windshield by the back of the creature that took up more space than there could possibly actually be in my small coupe. A long thin whip of a tail seemed to be curled back and forth across every remaining free surface of my car.

And then there was the creature's cock. I didn't know what it looked like --- yet --- but it remained inside of me. I felt like I had been impaled on one of Acropolis' enormous broken columns. I know that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I don't know how else to get the sensation across to you other than to exaggerate a little.

When my eyes had met the creatures, it looked right back at me. But not with any kind of human emotion. It was only a raw, animal intelligence. The intelligence of a predator cat, or an arctic wolf. And my sense was that it was using all of its intelligence to calculate how it could completely consume me.

Its claw wrapped around my neck. Not in a way that choked me --- I had no trouble breathing. More like it just found my neck a convenient handle to grab onto. But the sensation was disturbing: like my neck had been thrust into the hole through a cinder block.

Its other claw came down to my hip and closed hard on it. I could feel the sharp points digging in, and could only imagine those massive, slicing claws doing the same damage to the soft flesh of my thigh that he had done to the foam of the driver's-side seat.

It had briefly paused for a moment when I had looked back at it. But not it returned to the business of fucking me. I felt completely helpless. I wrapped my thin arms around the car seat and pressed my head against the headrest, trying to glean what little support I could from the familiar feel of my little car in front of me while I was being tortured by some surreal fairy-tale monster from behind.

The beast blew a long smoking breath of hot air across me. It could hear it snapping its teeth above me, like a dog snapping angrily in the air at someone it hates. The teeth-snap sound had a cavernous echo quality, I assume from a resonance in that huge head. The creature lunged forward, driving up into me and I could think of nothing but that huge stone cock breaking me apart. Something in the car seat broke from the irrepressible forward momentum, and there was a loud snap like the backbone of a small animal in the mouth of a killer backyard cat as the seat collapsed flat.

The creature was over me now, consuming all the space above me as it thrust into me. I braced my little feet against the dashboard and dug my fingers into the seat cushion. I buried my face in the headrest. I felt like I was trapped in the last remaining void of a collapsed building. Or like a miner who had belly-crawled into the narrowest of gaps 1000 feet underground. It felt like indescribable massiveness and weight above me. It felt like being fucked by the Earth itself.

I could imagine that from the outside my little red car must look like it was being destroyed from the inside. It's springs totally compressed, the whole body shaking up and down. Why didn't someone tap on the window to check on me? I suppose if anyone even noticed the unusual stance and motion of my car in the dark back part of the drive-in, they would simply feel somewhat jealous and not want to intrude.

I don't know how long this lasted (less than the running time of *Mulan*, I know that for a fact). But eventually it seemed to grow tired of being so cramped and unable to do what it really wanted to do to me. A stiffness had come into its thrusts --- I mean in the way it was moving: less serpentine and reptilian flow and more like the abortive energy-saving movements of a tired mammal.

It pulled me off its cock. I mean it like that: it grabbed me and wholly lifted me off its cock like I weigh no more than a small stuffed animal toy. It placed me into the back seat of the car, and I wiggled around in the tight space remaining to confront the monster face-on.

And now I could see its cock: a massive thing that indeed seemed to be made of stone rough and hard and cracked in places. Unlike Lucas' cock, it was not a well-proportioned thing. It looked massive even in relation to the huge body of the dragon-thing that was filling my car. Though maybe that was my own forced perspective. It thrust forward running in a long hard column towards me. It had a huge bulbous head that seemed to entirely circle it, and a channel that looked like it had been carved into the underside. From its base hung two huge ball sacks, that looked like boulders suspended in women's nylons.

It took the cock in its claw.

This is when I heard a sound coming from his throat. Something like "Keeeeshennshra." I realized it was my name. 

A long and curling serpent tongue unfurled from its mouth, and with electric speed whipped down between my unwittingly still-parted legs and licked my pussy. Its touch was so hot it scorched me. I was afraid it would leave welts. I couldn't help but let out a scream. 

"Keeeeshennshra. Yousssrrsh cunsh tassshes shhooo goossdshh!" It said. Or at least something like that. 

During all those phone sex sessions, when we couldn't be together physically, Lucas often mentioned how much he wanted to taste my pussy. I remembered that it was one thing in particular that he craved. Hearing the words expressing this through the susurrus of his hot exhale made me realize that my Lucas was still in there. I wasn't confronted with some raw terrifying animal monster, but Lucas in a different form.

This realization took the sharpest edge off my fear. I looked up into his eyes, and my tired body became slightly less tense. I could see his slitted eyes wandering over my body, and I thought perhaps he was seeing me as nobody ever had before. 

His giant stone cock floated in the air only a few inches above me and he was now stroking it madly as he looked at my naked, wet, exhausted body. I put my hand out and touched the bulbous tip of his cock and it was cold under my fingers.

It was at that moment he came. His head arched back and a roar that can't be imagined because it could only emanate from a creature that never existed before escaped from between his teeth.

The cramped and curved neck suddenly whipped back and forth dramatically. I could see every stone muscle in his body tense up --- which was something quite amazing to see: like watching an extremely realistic statue suddenly come to vivid life. His balls retracted upwards violently, and I could see fluid pumping along the channel cut in his dick.

Cum flowed out of him. It didn't shoot out, like it typically does from men, it poured out in a slow molten-rock, lava kind of way. Though it was bright white and nearly glowed in the cartoon light. There were massive amounts of it, a viscous and sticky slow-moving stream pouring forth. The stuff just kept flowing, like a rent in the Earth from which the hot liquid of the center bubbled out. 

It flowed off the end of the massive cock and poured down on my body. It was extremely hot --- like the temperature of the hottest shower you've ever taken --- and smoke or steam rose from it. It covered my tits like icing on a cake, and flowed down my belly burning me. It flowed over me and covered my like a blanket, pouring down between my legs, and scalding my pussy. I could feel it pooling under my ass and legs.

I closed my eyes and let the sensation _literally_ wash over me.

When I opened them again, Lucas was no longer a monster. He sat there in front of me, holding his cock in his hand, looking entirely dessicated from effort. Seeing his body so small and pale relative to what he had been moments before made me feel pity for him. He seemed so frail and weak.

I know what you are going to say: you'll say I imagined the whole thing. This was my mind playing tricks on me, or maybe you'll just assume I was on acid. Listen: I would tell you if that were the case. And if I imagined it, how do you explain my broken car seat? The deeply-gouged foam of the driver's-side seat? Or the fact that the whole drive back to his house I sat in a cooling, tacky puddle from the buckets of cum?

I never really talked to Lucas about the event. After we got back to his place, I left the next day, and we drifted apart after that --- the way long-distance relationships often do even without a calamitous event to rip it apart.

I never did see that *Mulan* movie.
