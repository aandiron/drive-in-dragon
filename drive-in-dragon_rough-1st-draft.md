First, I need you to understand that what I'm going to tell you about here might seem unbelievable, but it really happened to me. I say 'unbelievable' but I don't mean unbelievable like those old *Penthouse Forum Letters* where some wildly unlikely sex act supposedly actually happened. I haven't told anyone about this not out of prudish shyness (trust me, I am not a prude) or because I was afraid they wouldn't believe me, but because I was afraid they might think I had gone insane.

This all happened a very long time ago. But to this day I find the events of this one night some 25 years ago still arise in my thoughts far more often than I would like them to. Maybe what happened really only happened in my mind. Maybe I am actually crazy. But I don't think so. I think what happened was one of those rare things --- though perhaps not as rare as we're led to believe --- where something happened that was outside the bounds of what we consider "normal" reality. Whatever the explanation, I am hoping that by writing this all down, it will help my mind finally come to a more restful place, and put the whole thing behind me once and for all.
