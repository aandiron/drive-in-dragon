First, I need you to understand that what I'm going to tell you about here might seem unbelievable, but it really happened to me. I say 'unbelievable' but I don't mean unbelievable like those old *Penthouse Forum Letters* where some wildly unlikely sex act supposedly actually happened. I haven't told anyone about this before not because of prudish shyness (trust me, I am not a prude) or because I was afraid I wouldn't be believed, but rather because I was afraid they might think I had gone insane.

This all happened a very long time ago. But to this day I find the events of this one night some 25 years ago still arise in my thoughts far more often than I would like them to. Maybe what happened really only happened in my mind. Maybe I am actually crazy. But I don't think so. I think what happened was one of those rare things --- though perhaps not as rare as we're led to believe --- where something happened that was outside the bounds of what we consider "normal" reality. Whatever the explanation, I am hoping that by writing this all down, it will help my mind finally come to a more restful place, and put the whole thing behind me once and for all.

The circumstances that led up to the event were banal enough. I had driven my little red two-door coupe 6 hours out west into the deeply rural region of the state to visit my boyfriend at the time, Lucas. He was a sophomore at a tiny liberal arts college surrounded by farmland and more than an hour from any city of notable size. My relationship with Lucas had been long distance. Other than a few instances where we had been together it was held together mostly by very hot and passionate phone calls every evening, that almost invariable ended with us having long sessions of phone sex. At least, when I didn't fall asleep on him!

As you could imagine, all that phone passion ended mostly having the effect of building anticipation rather than being a reliable sexual outlet. I think by the time I made this trip out to see him we were both reaching a point where we were somewhat desperate for pure physical interlocking.

So it was annoying to arrive at the little house he rented with his friends, and realize that we didn't really have much privacy. There were all these boys around all the time. Underfed art students dressed in black mostly, who would hang out on the porch... and in the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, their bedrooms. In short, there were just always boys around. And all I wanted was Lucas to myself. We snuck in some quiet fucking the first night I was there, but I think we both felt like we didn't really have the freedom to be ourselves. It was slightly uncomfortable.

By the next evening I was so tired of all the art nerds that I was weighing the possibility of not staying the full three days like I had originally planned, and instead heading home with the end of the weekend the next day. When I mentioned this to Lucas though he looked so distraught that I had to immediately backpedal that idea.

At the same time, I think he completely understood where I was coming from, and immediately he tried to take some steps so that I would be more comfortable and enjoy myself more. "What if we go see a movie tonight?" He asked. "Out in the boonies like this town, there's still a couple of functional drive-in theaters around. And you have a car --- a rare asset none of the rest of us who live here have. How about we go see something."

"Hmm. That could be fun." I replied. I wasn't stupid, I immediately knew that a drive-in meant very little movie watching would actually get done. But I played along. "What's playing?"

Lucas found a copy of the local alternative paper on the coffee table. It was very thin and had a couple of coffee rings staining the cover, but it had the information we needed. "Well, Disney's *Mulan* is playing at the closest drive-in --- a mere 40 minutes away."

"*Mulan*? Isn't that a kid's movie? A cartoon?"

"Sure, but Disney's movies are generally solid entertainment these days. Even for adults. Besides, I like cartoons." Some of the little boy he still kind of was came through with this.

"Alright then. I don't feel too strongly about it. Take me to *Mulan* lover."

"We're not going to argue about this? I thought you said we were doomed as a couple because of our astrological signs?"

"You're a Gemini, I'm a Scorpio. That is a poison pill! Famously antagonistic. You and I, my hot little boy, are never going to work out."

"I am a rational person. I don't believe your occult magicks have any impact on the real world."

"And that right there is the first step towards our end baby."

The conversation was all in good humor, but it still put a little note of sour tiredness on everything we did for the next few hours while we waited for darkness to approach so we could head over to the drive-in.

By the time we were on our way to the drive-in, we had settled back into the dazed-crush state that our nightly phone calls has built up. It was hard not to feel romantic. I let Lucas drive my car, and we wound along narrow back country roads that would occasionally roll up to the top of hills from which we could see the liquid orange blob of the sun melting off on the Western horizon.

I kinda couldn't take my eyes off him. Really, he dressed just like all the other art nerds he hung around with. All in black, but not even tasteful black --- cheap oversized black tshirts, black pants, black combat boots. But this one was _my_ art nerd. I liked his shaved head, his paleness from rarely going out before dark, his young intensity.

He was trying to keep his eyes on the road, but he caught me staring at him. He gave me half a side-ways grin, and I leaned over and put my head on his shoulder. I had a smile on my face that I had no control over. I just kept grinning. I smiled as I sucked his ear. And I continued to smile as I undid his pants and slid my warm little hand down his underwear and took his cock in my hand. He was hard. Extremely hard. In that way that only 19 year old boys could be really. So hard that is gave not at all to the pressure of my fingers. It wasn't throbbing hard, it was just *hard* --- like a wooden dowel or something. There really wasn't anything I could even do with it. So I just held him in my hand while I whispered in his ear that he had better continue to concentrate on driving.

Somehow we made it to the drive-in without being killed. Lucas pulled my hand out and zipped himself up just as we pulled up to the booth. I could tell he was embarrassed by the hard on he was failing to hide while he paid for the movie. I was not embarrassed at all by the fact that my panties were already soaking wet.

I had worn something I knew he would like: a flowy black skirt that came down to just below my knees and a tight black halter top that made the most of the warm evenings of late summer, and my small breasts. I had put lipstick on before we left in a high-contrast red color that I remember loving in those younger years of mine.
